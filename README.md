## about whitespaces

Whitespace, designed in 2003 by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris, is an imperative, stack-based, esoteric programming language that uses only whitespace characters—space, tab, and linefeed—as syntax. All other characters are ignored. Whitespace got a brief moment of fame when it was posted on Slashdot on April 1st, 2003. Most people took it as an April Fool's joke, while it wasn't.
